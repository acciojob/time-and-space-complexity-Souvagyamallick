	 <h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>

    <p>
        Time complexity refers to the efficiency of an algorithm concerning the amount of time it takes to
        execute as a function of the input size. Efficient algorithms are designed to have low time complexity,
        ensuring that they perform tasks quickly even with large datasets.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Space Complexity</b> is another critical aspect of algorithm analysis. It measures the amount of memory
        space an algorithm requires to execute in relation to the input size. Algorithms with lower space complexity,
        often denoted as <b>O(n)</b>, use memory efficiently and are preferred in memory-constrained environments.
